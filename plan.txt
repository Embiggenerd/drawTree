1. User can use text editor on the left to create or read articles (no visual diff b/t edit and read mode)
2. User can use tree on the right to search articles in tree form
  a. User clicks on a node to bring up article
    1. What does a node look like?
    2. Node per article, or node per paragraph?
  b. To create new article, user clicks '+' symbol where node would go on tree
    1. If not sure of node position, user clicks '+' on left, connects node later
3. User can reference other articles or paragraphs  
4. Search tree has two initial perspectives: 
  a. Initial tree structure created by user
